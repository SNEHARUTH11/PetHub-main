petfinder is an Indian online Connect with your perfect furry companion and empower animal welfare organizations with our Pet Adoption Website, featuring pet searches, user accounts, wish lists, adoption requests, and admin controls.

In this project, We have tried to make a FULL-STACK project by manipulating dom elements using REACT, managing state changes using REDUX, CHAKRA UI Library, styling using CSS in react, styling components, and trying to make a responsive website and implementing dynamic routing to persist data. We have managed our database globally using MongoDB Atlas and Express. With the self-learning efforts and the technology stack we have learned till Unit-6 in the Masai School, we could clone the whole website with the same looks & features.

This is a collaborative project built within 5 days by a team of 4 members
